question 1: Source :-Code with mosh
create an a custom array class and add the following methods
1)  insert
2) removeat
3) indexOf



solution;

i created a class named Arrray that inputs an initial size 

1) in building the insert() method i used array.push method to insert items into my array 
2) in building the removeAt() method. the method receives an index.  i used the array.splice(index,1)
    to delete item in that index
3) in building the indexOf method. the method receives a value . i use the findindex method to get 
the index and return it.
