question :
Build a hash table from scratch. Use linear probing strategy for
handling collisions. Implement the following operations:
- put(int, String)
- get(int)
- remove(int)
- size()


solution: first i built a HashTable class that takes in an integer as the size an use the size to build an array
          i create a function in the class to validate integers. 

          in implementing the put() method i validate the input if they are the required types, then i check if the 
          inputed key is already existed. if it existed i use the find method to find the data change its value .
          if the key does not exist in the bucket, i check if the bucket is full. if the buckets are filled i return 
          and log buckets are filled. if the buckets are not filled i use the linear probing method to hash the key 
          i use a while loop so that if there is a collisions the linear probing method moves the data to the next 
          avialable index.

          in implementing the get method. the method receives a key. i first validate the received key then use the 
          array. find method to loop through the buckets to get the required data.

          in implementing the remove method . i validate the key first, use the findIndex method to get the position 
          of the data the set the value of that index to 0.

          in implementing the size () method i just return this.size
