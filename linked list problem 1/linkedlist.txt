problem 1 :

build a linked list and implement the following methods 
1) insertFirst
2) insertLast
3) deleteFirst
4) deleteLast
5) indexOf



Solution 
1)   this.head = new Node(data, this.head);
    this.size++;
    in a linked list the head is always linked t the first element.
    So to insert an element as the last element i make the element as the
    head an shift the rest of the elements as the next

2)  if there is no element in the linked list i insert it as the first element
    else i loop through the list and place the element at the last place and increase the 
    size by one

3)  i check if the size of the list is greater than 0 and if it is i equate the next as the
    head and reduce the size by one
  
4)  i check if the size of the list is greater than 1 then i loop through the list for each
    value of i form i equals 1 to i equals size -1 to get the second to the last item the i
    set the next value to null
