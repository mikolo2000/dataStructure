problem 2:

add the following methods to the linked list class u created

1)insertAtIndex()
2)deleteIndex()
3)makeArray() that is use the linkedlist items to make an makeArray
4)reverse() that is the list should start from the last to the first
5)KthNodeFromTheEnd() 


solution:
1)    this method takes two arguments the data to be imputed and the index to input it. 
      i first check if the index is a valid index then i check if the index is between 0
      and the size of the list. if the index = 0 i use the insertFirst() method to insert
      it at the head and shit the position of others.
      if the index is greater than zero but valid. i loop through the list to the value before
      the index and copy the next node. i use a new node to pass in the data at the index 
      then input the copied value as the next property of the new node. then i increase the size
      by one.
      
2)    i first check if the index is a valid index then i check if the index is between 0
      and the size of the list. if the index = 0 i use the deleteFirst() method to delete
      it at the head and shit the position of others.
      if the index is greater than zero but valid. i loop through the list to the value before
      the index and copy the next node. i pass the next item of the node i copied to the next of 
      the node before index to delete so as to remove the data with the given index. then i reduce
      the size by one.

3)    i declear an empty array. then i looped through the linked list pushing the value of each of 
      item in the list into the array. then return the array.

4)    i use the makeArray() method to create an array with the linkedlist datas. use the forEach loop
      to insert each of the items in the array in the linked list through the insertFirst() method.

5)    i decleared two variables and equate the to the head, i use the for on variable a to loop to 
      create a distance of k-1 between the two variable . then i used a while loop to move a and 
      b trying to equate a to the last item in the list. which implies the data in the position in 
      which b is in is the data we a looking for.
