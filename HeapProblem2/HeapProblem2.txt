Question: This question is designed to help you get a better understanding of basic heap operations.

There are  types of query:

" " - Add an element  to the heap.
" " - Delete the element  from the heap.
"" - Print the minimum of all the elements in the heap.
NOTE: It is guaranteed that the element to be deleted will be there in the heap. Also, at any instant, only distinct elements will be in the heap.

Input Format

The first line contains the number of queries, .
Each of the next  lines contains one of the  types of query.

Constraints


Output Format

For each query of type , print the minimum value on a single line.

Solution: To solve this problem, I implemented a Min Heap to handle the three types of queries: inserting an element, deleting an element, and retrieving the minimum element. The heap is represented as an array, with the first element at index 1 to simplify parent-child index calculations. The add() function inserts a new element at the end and then bubbles it up to maintain the heap property. The delete() function swaps the target element with the last element, removes it, and then bubbles down to ensure the heap remains valid. The getMin() function simply returns the minimum element, which is always at index 1.
